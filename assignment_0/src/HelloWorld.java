public class HelloWorld {

  //? Function assumptions:
  //1.) public means its accessible to public scope
  //2.) static means main() can be accessed without HelloWorld instance instantiated
  //3.) void means it doesn't return anything
  //4.) not sure why main() require String[] arguments
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World");
  }
